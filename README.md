# Quarkus Camel Project
This is a sample project on how to use the Camel Extension in Quarkus in a more advanced usecase. The Camel Route calls a Rest endpoint to get the location from your request IP address, then extracts longtitude and latitude from the JSON response.  These location parameters are then added to another Rest webservice call to get the weather temperature at your location. Finally this values is written into a txt.file.

To run this project you need to sign up (for free) with the two webservices used and add the tokens to the application.properties. 

http://ipgeolocation.io/
https://openweathermap.org/api

Then you can jst run the app and the route will run every 5 seconds. 

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.html.
